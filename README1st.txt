Inland Project's README file.

Package Overview
================

The Integrated Model of Land Surface Processes (Inland) is the land surface package for the Brazilian Earth System Model. The Inland project is coordinated by Marcos Heil Costa (UFV) and Gilvan Sampaio (INPE), with funding from BrazilÂ´s Ministry of Science and Technology programs Rede Clima and INCT.

When completed, Inland will represent a number of land surface processes:
1. Canopy biophysics, including water and energy balance, ice processes, turbulence and aerodynamics
2. Plant physiology processes, including light interception, photosynthesis and respiration, canopy conductance and interactions with soil fertility
3. Soil physics, including energy ans water balance, infiltration, surface runoff and deep drainage 
4. Short-term vegetation dynamics (phenology)
5. Long-term vegetation dynamics, including GPP, NPP, allocation, primary and secondary growth, mortality and competition among plant functional types
6. Distturbances and fires
7. Crop phenology and management, including planting dates, emergence, growth, grain filling, senescence and harvest
8. Soil biogeochemistry, with varying levels of complexity fro carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous
9. Land surface hydrological processes, including rivers, lakes, wetlands and floodplains

The model is forced by meteorological hourly data or regional daily or monthly climate data, or can be coupled to regional or global climate models. 

Inland is based on the IBIS model from SAGE center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (http://www.sage.wisc.edu/download/IBIS/ibis.html)

Main modifications from IBIS to INLAND
======================================
Released now (2012):
1. All code converted to fortran 90, double precision and dynamic memory allocation
2. Grid and single point versions unified in the same code (different compilations though)
3. Code is multi-thread ready
4. Offline code accepts four frequencies of input data: climate monthly means, monthly time series and daily time series (grid version), hourly time series (single point version)
5. Documentation prepared (the most detailed documentation is available in portuguese only)
6. Uses the GNU Build System

To appear in the next release (expected in 2013):
1. Incorporation of the crop and hydrological codes in the same version (AgroIBIS and THMB)
2. Incorporation of the fire code in the same version
3. Specific pft parameterization for South American biomes
4. Possibility of using Optis, a parameter optimizer for Inland
5. Drivers for coupling to atmospheric models

As an effort to keep the model up to date and in the most useful form, we would like to receive your feedback. If you make any substantial changes to the code please let us know. Your change may be incorporated in the next version of the code. The code is under constant development and your suggestion will help us to improve the code. If you experience any problems with the model or have any questions please do not hesitate to contact us at inland@inpe.br
