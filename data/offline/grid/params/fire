# #, *, c, C, ! or / denote comments in this file. Input routine 
# will ignore any text to the right of these symbols, anywhere they 
# occur....  So feel free to comment freely! There are only two 
# rules to observe when placing data and comments in this file.
# Rule 1: data must be in the correct order, as indicated below, but
#         lines can be separated by blanks or comments and individual
#         fields can be separated by blanks or line-ends any way you 
#         like.
# Rule 2: you MAY NOT join any consecutive lines of data. In general
#         this is not a problem so long as the existing sequence of
#         line-ends and commented separators is retained. In principle, 
#         you are free to remove comment lines, but if at a later date
#         you attempt to join two consecutive lines of data, where the
#         input routine is not expecting this, it *will* break the 
#         program (though not irreparably).
# Rule 3: THERE IS NO RULE 3!!!

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Parameters from Arora and Boer fire model
#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# blow     : Lower biomass threshold below which fire occurrence 
#            probability is zero (kgC m-2)
# bup      : Upper biomass threshold above which biomass availability
#            is not a constraint for fire occurrence (kgC m-2)
# betae    : Extinction wetness content above which fire occurrence
#            probability is negligible (dimensionless)
# Ph       : Fire occurrence probability due to human causes (fraction)
# g0       : Spread fire rate dependence on wind for calm conditions 
#            (dimensionless)
# alpha    : Factor of decay for spread fire rate dependence on wind 
#            (dimensionless)
#            alpha =1/2500 in Arora and Boer; alpha=8.16326e-4 in CTEM code
# umax     : Maximum fire spread rate (km h-1)
#            umax =0.45 in Arora and Boer; umax=0.28 in global model
# reparea  : Representative area of 1000 kmÂ²
# exfire   : Fire extinguishing probability (fraction)
